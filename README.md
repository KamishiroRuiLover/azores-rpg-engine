# azores-rpg-engine
A cool engine made for small RPGs. It's pretty neat!

See the wiki for details on how it works n stuff

It was originally created as a copy of the original Legend of Zelda game in python, but then I thought of this.
Have fun with it!

btw, this is my first github project, so... Idrk how this works.
